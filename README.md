## Security

WARNING: There are reported security issues with pickle, which is the backend serialization for this feature. A signature using a shared secret and a configurable hash algorithm has been added to mitigate this risk which will attempt to verify the data has not been altered. [See pickle documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)
